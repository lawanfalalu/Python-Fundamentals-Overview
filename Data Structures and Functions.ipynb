Python lists are also _mutable_ and _dynamic_, and allow us to access their elements using indices.\n",

We won't explore this further in this tutorial, but it is important to note that keys must be _hashable_. Finally, given that we want to enforce uniqueness, it is also the case that keys shouldn't be able to be changed: this would prevent us from checking that they are unique.
